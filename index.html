     <h1>Hello, I'm Célia 👋</h1>

      <img src="images/photo-de-profil.jpg" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Célia Clement">

      <p>I am currently a student in first year at IÉSEG. I love travelling 🌎 and I am volunteering in associations for 4 years. I really love taking some of my time to create and manage projects. I am curious and always looking for new things to learn. I also really love photography 📸, I have indeed a specific Instagram account for videos and photos of my trips.</p>

      <h2>My passions 🗺</h2>

      <p>I love travelling, my dream is to make a world tour on my own. I had the chance to travel very young with my parents, and it taught me not to be afraid of the unknown. I got also this passion for the music, in every sense of the word: playing music, listening music, singing and dancing. I play the guitar 🎸 and the piano 🎹, and I wish I won't stop here!</p>

      <h2> My hobbies 🎊</h2>
      
      <p>Like a normal woman of my age, I like partying and hang out with my friends. I think social life is really important at this life stage to really understand what we like and what we dislike. I also love watching TV shows on my own, reading, chilling and of course have time with my family. Family is really important to me. </p>

     <h2>My projects👩‍🎓</h2>
      <p>My projects for the moment is to continue my studies, and be active in an association. I love being implicated and manage events because it makes me "enter the real world". It can be hard sometimes but I think this is the experience that makes me the most growing up. I don't really know yet what to do after my studies but I am still young, and one thing that I am sure of is that I made the good choice in being a student at IÉSEG! </p>
